# How to order and assemble

## PCB and PCBA manufacturer

This directory contains Gerber files for the PCB, a BOM file with LCSC numbers for ordering with JLCPCB, and a CPL file.

### Orientations

Be careful with the orientation of the FPC connector on both this and the main board. Pin 1 is indicated on the board. When placed correctly on both the Open LCC and Debug board, you should use an FPC cable with *connectors on opposite sides*. If for some reason the connector is incorrectly oriented, you'll still be able to use the boards, but you may need an FPC cable with connectors on the *same* side. 

Orientations in general are a bit of a pain. I recommend checking the "Confirm production files" option on JLCPCB, to be able to verify that the orientations of all the components match the PCB and schematic.

## Parts you'll need from other vendors

The BOM in the file isn't complete; you'll need a few other parts, all of which are hand soldered. Below is a table, including links to Digikey when the item is available there.
